======

Welcome to Whisk, a simple set of useful LESS mixins and functions that may help to speed up the development of your project.

We are looking to extend Whisk to become an ever more powerful set of useful functions covering all aspects of your front-end development process.

If you need any help using Whisk, head over to the [docs page](http://whisk.glitchpack.com/documents.php) for a full breakdown and instructions.

Whisk utilises the amazing LESS language (http://lesscss.org).

If you do use Whisk, it would be great if you could include an attribution link in your compiled CSS, something like...
